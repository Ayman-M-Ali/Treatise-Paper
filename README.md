You will discover:

•  Carousel (sliding images).

•  Counting numbers after scrolling.

•  Intersection Observer API.

•  Tap to Top Button.

•  JavaScript Form Validation (high level).

•  Integrate the form in the website with Formspree API to receive requests from students.

•  View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size.


## Technologies Used

The following technologies were utilized in this project:

•  HTML

•  CSS (BEM)

•  Flexbox

•  CSS Grid

•  SCSS

•  Bootstrap5

•  Many features in JavaScript

•  Vite.js

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript. You will also need to have a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your computer.

To view the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The website should display correctly in the browser.
